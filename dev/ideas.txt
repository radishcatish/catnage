>	General
		- use a lot more classes and global functions. make everything as component-based and object-oriented as possible.
		- pressing a certain key should switch to kitting in applicable areas 
		- find a better name for kitting, christ's sake man

>	Hitbox, Hurtbox, and Bumpbox System
		- hitboxes should have a defense number and knockback resistance number
		- hurtboxes should keep a list of the things that were hit by it as to not hit them every frame

	>	Player
			- hurtboxes are made via a function that takes time in seconds, a vector for relative position, a vector for direction, damage amount, power, and knockback
			- the actual hurtbox scene will have all of those same variables
			- the hitbox for witz should change shape depending on how he's posed
 
 
	>	Enemy
	
			- hurtbox creation function is in a global script instead, with an extra param after time that tells it where the hurtbox goes
			- the actual hurtbox scene will have all of those same variables except the extra param, because the global script puts it there itself
	
> 	Attacks and Movement
	
	- if two attacks with equal power clash, add the knockback of both and apply it to both things away from eachother
	- if two attacks with equal damage clash, the one with more power gets the hit
	
	>	Player
			- player can doubletap left or right to start running, OR hold shift. this can and should be able to be changed to always run in settings
			- z jumps (no shit), x attacks, and c modifies. pressing c should mean high risk high reward, like slow attack but high power
			- space should be dodge
			- make sure to add armor when doing a strong attack


> 	Gameplay Additions

	>	Experience Points
	
		- you can gain EXP via getting points in levels. however, it has to be *fresh* points. if you complete a level with a high score, then complete it again with a lower score, you'll only get 1/4th the amount of EXP, or a little bit more depending on:
			= if it is a hard level
			= if it has a boss
			= if it has special challenges or clear conditions, and you complete it
			= if you get a better time 
			= you have an EXP badge
		
		- you can also get EXP by getting large combos, seperate from the points you get from it.
		- there should be an EXP cap. If reached, every X amount of EXP converts to one of the currency from the world you're in, depending on how valuable it is.
		- at certain milestones, you get rewards. these can't be money, as it wouldn't make sense, so perhaps badge points, or extra badges.
		
	>	Badges
		
			- badges should be upgradable if possible
			- all badges should be equal in some way (unless very hard to get), and should have a good reason to use it 
			- there are badge points, like the Paper Mario series.
			
			> Badge Ideas

				- all levels, badge points, and prices are examples, and shouldn't reflect how they are ingame. 

				- Plus Attack
					= "Increases your damage by X, lowers your power by Y."
					= does what it says on the tin
					= levels:  (1, 1),  (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1)
					= badge points: 5
					= price: should be low hightier, and gets more expensive exponentially

				- Plus Defense
					= "Increases your defense by X, at a cost to your damage and power."
					= damage and power are consistently decreased by floor(added_defense / 3 + 1)
					= levels: increase by 1 for each level
					= badge points: 3
					= price: midtier
			
				- Good Bad Internet
					= "Increases the lag of your attacks, but makes them stay out longer."
					= hitboxes are't activated until X frames late, but they stay out Y frames longer.
					= levels:  (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 6), (2, 5), (1, 4), (0, 4)
					= badge points: 2 + LVL / 2 
					= price: should be high lowtier when first bought, but get exponentially more expensive when levelled up.

				- Switcharoo
					= "Your damage and defense are swapped!"
					= badge points: 2
					= price: low midtier

				- Priority Attacks
					= "Your damage is halved, but your power is doubled"
					= basically you overpower more attacks but the damage you do is ass. would be fucking DEVASTATING with plus attack, but you'd use most if not all of your BP
					= badge points: 5
					= cannot be used with: Nimble, because you wouldn't do any fuckin damage
					= price: high midtier

				- Nimble
					= "You have decreased damage, power, defense, and can't do smash attacks, but you're a lot faster in every aspect"
					= idfk what to say about this lmao
					= levels: if leveled up, removes the power debuff and gives you a bit more damage
					= badge points: 3
					= cannot be used with: Tank
					= should be on the higher end of midtier in terms of price

				- Tank
					= "You have increased damage, power, and defense. However, you can only do smash attacks, but they're a bit faster. Your movement speed is also a bit slower too"
					= i also dfk what to say about this
					= badge points: 8
					= cannot be used with: Nimble, because it would cancel it out
					= price: hightier

				- Damage Fuel
					= "Your combo level adds + X to your damage, but you start with 0 damage"
					= note, you still do knockback and can clash, it's just your damage changing
					= levels: increase by 1 for each level
					= badge points: 5
					= price: hightier

				- Plus Aerials
					= "You can do X more aerials midair without hitting something"
					= levels: increase by 1 for each level
					= badge points: 2
					= price: hightier

				- Plus DI
					= "You can influence your movement direction more"
					= this literally adds velocity to your input direction
					= levels: get faster for each level
					= badge points: 1
					= price: hightier
